Hello,

we are students at the School of Art and Design Kassel, Germany ( http://kunsthochschulekassel.de ) interested in critical games and exploring everything about gamethings.
Our university is currently searching for artists to fill a vacant position as professor for our newly emerging games department.

If you know someone who could be interested in applying for this position we would appreciate if you could share this message with them - or maybe you are even interested yourself which would be even more amazing.

You can find more information about the vacancy at the university website:
http://www.uni-kassel.de/intranet/aktuelles/stellenangebote/stellenausschreibung-details/tx_ukstellenausschreibung/27303.html
Deadline for applications is the 3rd of February.

We are only students at the KHK, but wanted to share this with all the cool people we know in the hopes of getting a lot of interesting people to applicate!

If you have any questions about the position or the school you can contact the mail address detailed on the website (c.joseph@uni-kassel.de),
or just write us back and we'll try to answer as best as we can.

Thanks for taking the time reading this.

Kind regards,
Nicole and Chris
